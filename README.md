# My Project: Wake-up Machine
This is my arduino uno and some modules related to a project.

</br>
</br>
The project was to make a wake-up machine, and the purpose of making this machine was because the traditional alarm clock was annoying, so our team used water to awake the user. Its name is water alarm clock.

Repository Contents:
============
Here I provide a map of all thr top-level contents:
- /ProjectWriteup - project paper/write-up
- /codeLib - Any libraries that are needed to build your software for you device 
- /example - Example files that can be run on your hardware
- /other - Proposal and useless somethings
- /picture - This is where the image files for this readme are! Yay! Yay! hah
- /LICENCE - The license file.
- /hardware - All the design files 
- /README.de - The file you're reading now! xD





The first step: Prepare materials
============
Materials Required List:
- 1 x Arduino UNO
- 1 x Bread-board
- 1 x Servo
- 1 x Cup and water
- 1 x TRC (Clock module) 
- 1 x Piezo buzzer
- 1 x LED Strip
- 2 x Potentiometers
- as much wires as your need


The second step: set up the board
============
The circuit diagram is as followsï¼š

</br>


The third step: download the libraries
============
Download the libraries from:
</br>
https://github.com/HanPeizhi/CS207-Project/tree/master/code
</br>
</br>
There are two folders:
- Dht11
- RTC
</br>
Download these two whole folders, and add under your path: ..\Arduino\libraries
</br>


The fourth step: download the example code
============
The Complete demo code can download from here:
</br>
https://github.com/HanPeizhi/CS207-Project/tree/master/example
</br>
Then Upload to you arduino.
</br>


The fifth step: fix the servo and cup
============
I gripped the servo with an iron clip and then nailed the iron shelf to the wall with a spike:

</br>
</br>
I used a nail to pocke a hole in the bottom edge of the paper cup. Then we nailed two tacks on the wall.
</br>

</br>
</br>
Here I put the servo on the edge of the mouth of the paper cup, so the servo can jam and release the paper cup when the servo turns:

</br>

The sixth step: Complete project map
===========
I fixed the Arduino on the wall with just a few studs:
</br>

I simply glued the breadboard can stick the breadboard on the wall. 
</br>
If you do not like sticky glue on the wall, we also use tacks to support the breadboard on the wall:

Team
===========
The build team consist of:
- Peizhi Han -- I did everything. </br>
